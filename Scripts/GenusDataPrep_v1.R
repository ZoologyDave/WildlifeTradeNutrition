# Preparing raw data from GENuS ######
# If you put a load of hashes at the end of a line, it allows "code folding" in RStudio.
# So if you look to the left of "Preparing raw data from GENus" there is a little arrow. 
# Click on that and it hides the code until the next set of hashes.
# Similarly, those hashes (or ----- ) allow you to navigate through code. If you look at 
#    bottom of this window, you can see a little drop-down menu that allows you to 
#    navigate to different bits of the script
